# FF-Notebook

## Overview
For my second project at General Assembly, I have created a fantasy football notebook. Fantasy football players are always looking for a leg up on their competition no matter how small. This means scouting high profile players as early as high school. As an avid fantasy football player myself, the notes in my phone are filled with players that I don't want to forget. This is where the fantasy football notebook comes in. It allows you to section out players that you want to keep track of in a developmental section, rookie section, or veteran section. When adding the players into the notebook, you can add personal notes about the player as well as edit them later.
